        <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/10/28/generative-ai/"><h2>Why 'generative AI' is suddenly on everyone's lips: It's an 'open field'</h2></a>
        <small>Published on October 29, 2022</small>
        <p>This article talks about generative AI, a new kind of AI that can produce human-quality creative text and images. 
          The sudden capability is due to the vast amount of data and the improvement of processing power. This technology is 
          still under development, but it has already been applied in game design. The future of generative AI is open source and 
          specialized models. People should embrace this technology as a productivity tool instead of fearing being replaced by it.</p>

        <small>Published on October 14, 2022</small>
        <p>This blog post discusses how video games have been using AI to create unique stories for players. In the past, player interactions with characters were predetermined by the game's story. However, games like Shadow of Mordor use procedurally 
          generated characters that develop their personalities and traits based on how the player interacts with them. This creates a more dynamic and personal story for each player, where enemies can become stronger and more determined to defeat you, 
          or co-workers can be recruited to your cause based on your actions. The article also mentions other examples of AI-driven storytelling in games and suggests this is an area with a lot of potential for future development.</p>

        <small>Published on March 21, 2022</small>
        <p>The article explores the concept of the metaverse, a new iteration of the internet. It discusses the ambiguity surrounding the definition, with some considering it a single virtual world and others a network of interconnected virtual spaces. 
          There are questions about the hardware required to access the metaverse, with bulky VR headsets being a current hurdle. The article explores alternative solutions such as browser-based platforms and cloud-streamed graphics. There are also concerns 
          about privacy and control over these virtual spaces, especially if owned by large corporations. Overall, the article suggests the metaverse is still under development and the true form it will take is unclear.</p>
